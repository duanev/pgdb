To run pgdb with qemu, install qemu-system-x86_64, then:

$ cd pgdb/examples/qemu/x86_64/oz-x86-64-asm-001
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -boot a -fda oz_fd -s -S -monitor stdio
(then in another terminal)
$ cd pgdb
$ python pgdb.py -nasmlst examples/qemu/x86_64/oz-x86-64-asm-001/oz_fd.lst

then press 'h', 'l', 'j' to get rolling,
text search for lgdt '/lgdt' if you want to skip to 64bit mode quickly,
use 'mgdt@gdt,3' to see the gdt,
use 's' through the long jump and qemu will shift into 64bit mode and
    pgdb will load pgdb_x86_64 and change the cpu windows.
this version doesn't handle interrupts yet.

You can quit without killing qemu with 'q', then restart pgdb and
it will reload the current cpu state where you left off, or 'Q' to
exit both and start over.
